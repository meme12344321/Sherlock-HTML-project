    <li>The Speckled Band</li>
    <p>The Adventure of the Speckled Band" is the eighth Sherlock Holmes short story, and the tenth Holmes story overall (following the novels A Study in Scarlet and The Sign of the Four), by British author Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. It was originally
      published in Strand Magazine in February 1892, with illustrations by Sidney Paget, and later as the eighth story in the collection The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes. The story tells of Helen Stoner, a soon-to-be married young woman who suspects
      her stepfather may be trying to kill her in order to retain control of her inheritance. Convinced of her stepfather's intentions, she turns to Holmes for help.</p>
    <li>The Red-Headed League.</li>
    <p>The Red-Headed League" is one of the 56 Sherlock Holmes short stories written by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. It first appeared in The Strand Magazine in August 1891, with illustrations by Sidney Paget. Conan Doyle ranked "The Red-Headed League"
      second in his list of his twelve favorite Holmes stories. It is also the second of the twelve stories in The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, which was published in 1892.</p>
    <li>The Dancing Men</li>
    <p>The Adventure of the Dancing Men is a Sherlock Holmes story written by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle as one of 13 stories in the cycle published as The Return of Sherlock Holmes in 1905. It was first published in The Strand Magazine in the United
      Kingdom in December 1903, and in Collier's in the United States on 5 December 1903.
